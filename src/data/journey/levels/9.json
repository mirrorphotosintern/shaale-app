Gunda tries to go around — Aame slowly swivels to face him again.\n\nAame speaks in a slow Kannada riddle. Gunda listens hard, uses question words to answer correctly. Aame considers for a long moment... then shuffles to the side. As Gunda passes, Aame says one more thing. Gunda: \"What did that mean?\" Gubbi shrugs.",
