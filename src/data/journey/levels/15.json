Gunda and Arjun stand at the summit entrance together.\n\nGubbi steps onto a flat stone in the summit clearing, opens her wings — full electric blue — and begins to sing. Each note is a word they learned. The mist moves. The Karadi bear steps from the forest into the light, ancient and calm. It looks at Gubbi. Then at Gunda. Then walks back into the mountain. Gubbi lands on Gunda's shoulder. Far below in the haze: the lights of Bengaluru. Home.",
