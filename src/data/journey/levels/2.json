He tries the other side — blocked again.\n\nThen a soft crackling sound from his bag. The egg, stirring.\n\nThe Aane goes completely still. Lowers its enormous head toward the bag. Takes one long breath through its trunk. Then steps aside — deliberate, respectful — and watches Gunda walk through.\n\nThe forest recognised the egg before Gunda did.",
