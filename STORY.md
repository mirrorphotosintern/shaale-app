## THE PREMISE

Gunda is a chubby, expressive Indian boy from Bengaluru who barely speaks Kannada. His Ajji (grandmother) lives in a village beyond Karadi Betta forest. She sent him a package: an egg in cloth, and a handwritten letter in Kannada that nobody in the house can read. Gunda decides to go to her himself — to hand her the egg, and to finally read that letter face to face.

The catch: Karadi Betta's forest only speaks Kannada. And Gunda has a rival — **Arjun**, a city kid who grew up speaking Kannada, already has a 2-day head start, and whose bird Kaage (a crow) already knows the first phase words.

The mechanic: **Gubbi is a Neelakantha (Indian Roller — Karnataka's state bird). The egg Ajji sent only responds to Kannada — it absorbs the energy of every word Gunda learns correctly and grows warmer. When enough words have been learned, it hatches. Gubbi's feathers develop and evolve as Gunda's Kannada deepens.** Every lesson = Gubbi gets closer to being able to fly.

**The letter is the ogatu.** Ajji's letter contains a traditional riddle (ಒಗಟು) written in Kannada. As Gunda learns more letters on his journey, more of the letter becomes readable in the app. The five clues are revealed at each milestone. The answer — ಕನ್ನಡ — only becomes typeable once Gunda has learned the letters to spell it.

## CHARACTERS

### Gunda
- **Age:** 8-9 years old
- **Appearance:** Chubby Indian boy, Pixar 3D style, orange embroidered kurta, wide expressive eyes, messy hair
- **Personality:** Curious, brave, awkward in language, emotionally intelligent
- **Speaks:** Mostly English, almost no Kannada at the start
- **Arc:** English-speaking city kid → genuine Kannada speaker through lived experience

### Gubbi (The Neelakantha — Indian Roller)
Karnataka's state bird. Starts dull brown. Develops electric blue wings as Gunda learns Kannada.
- **Stage 1 (L1–4):** Dull brown hatchling, eyes barely open, walks clumsily
- **Stage 2 (L5–9):** Small iridescent wing patches, can flutter, eyes fully alert
- **Stage 3 (L10–14):** Full blue wings, glides short distances, runs ahead on trails
- **Stage 4 (L15+):** Full electric blue plumage, soars freely, can sing the ancient song

**The Mechanic:** Gubbi's feathers glow when she hears correct Kannada. Each letter learned = new ability unlocked. She IS the reason Gunda pushes through.

### Amma
- Gunda's mother. Warm, protective, urban Bengaluru. Doesn't speak much Kannada.
- Gets the package from Ajji, tries to read the letter — can't
- Packs Gunda's bag. Tucks the egg in first, letter alongside it. Doesn't stop him going.
- Says: *"Ajji said this egg was yours when it arrived."* That's enough.

### Appa
- Gunda's father. Speaks fragments of Kannada but has mostly forgotten it.
- Tries to read the letter. Gets a word or two. Shrugs helplessly.
- Present but not the quest-giver — this is Gunda's decision, not his

### Ajji
- Gunda's grandmother. Lives in a village beyond Karadi Betta.
- Speaks almost no English. Full, warm, funny Kannada only.
- Sent the package knowing Gunda couldn't read it yet. She's waiting.
- The letter she wrote IS the ogatu. She knew what she was doing.
- The final scene: Gunda arrives. They sit together. He reads her letter back to her. She cries.

### Arjun
- Rival, same age as Gunda
- Grew up speaking Kannada at home
- His bird: **Kaage** (a black crow) — already knows Phase 1 words
- Not mean, just confidently ahead. Mildly condescending early on, genuine peer by end
- Doesn't believe the Karadi bear is real. Just wants to win.
- His arc: skeptic → witness

### Bekku (Forest Cat)
- A large, silent forest cat. Appears at Level 6.
- Follows them through the whole journey from the shadows
- Initially terrifying. Gradually revealed as protector.
- At Level 11: catches Gubbi mid-fall
- Never speaks. Communicates through posture and eyes.

### Aane (Elephant)
- Appears at Levels 1 and 2
- First creature Gunda successfully communicates with
- Warm, slow, ancient. Responds to respectful Kannada.

### Monkey / Kathe Mara
- Level 3. Mischievous thief. Steals Gunda's map.
- Returns it when impressed by Gunda's Kannada. Fair trade.

### Baby Deer (Cheruve)
- Level 4. Lost, crying at night in the dark.
- Gunda comforts it. It shows him the safe path forward.

### Aame (Old Tortoise)
- Level 9. Blocks the path. Tests Gunda with Kannada riddles.
- Ancient, patient, slightly smug about it.

### Monkey King
- Level 12. Rules a territory on the mountain.
- Tests with verb commands. Gives a shortcut map when satisfied.

### Karadi Bear
- The legendary spirit guardian of Karadi Betta
- Nobody has seen it in a generation
- Appears only when a Neelakantha sings the complete ancient song
- Gunda's Tata described seeing it once — this is why Gunda is here
- The final payoff

## CUTSCENE SCRIPTS

### SCENE 0 — "Ajji's Package" *(Before Level 1 begins)*
**Duration:** 20–25 seconds | **Song:** None

> A package arrives. Gunda tears into it — sweets, a small wrapped thing, the usual. He pushes past it all. At the bottom: an egg wrapped in a small cloth, glowing faintly when he touches it. And a letter.
>
> Dense Kannada script, front and back. To Gunda it's completely unreadable — a wall of shapes.
>
> He takes it to Amma. She frowns at it, tries — shakes her head. Appa the same. A word or two, maybe. Not enough.
>
> Amma picks up the egg, wraps it carefully back in its cloth. Tucks it into Gunda's bag. Puts the letter in beside it.
>
> *"Ajji said this egg was yours when it arrived."*
>
> Gunda zips the bag. Looks at the door.
>
> He walks out. Nobody stops him.

**Visual note:** Warm indoor light, the unreadable letter in close-up — the audience sees what Gunda sees: Kannada script that means nothing yet. This is the itch the whole app scratches.
**Ogatu note:** The letter Gunda carries IS Ajji's ogatu. Five lines. All dark. Line 1 becomes readable at Lesson 5.

---

### SCENE 1 — "Goodbye" *(Level 1 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Gunda at the door. Bag on his back, egg inside it.
>
> Amma holds his face in both hands for a moment. Lets go. Appa gives him a firm pat on the shoulder. The building watchman waves. A neighbour aunty calls something from her balcony. His friend from downstairs runs up and gives him a fistbump.
>
> Gunda looks back once at the building. Then turns and walks.
>
> City gives way to outskirts. Outskirts to road. Road to treeline.
>
> Karadi Betta ahead.

---

### SCENE 2 — "The Aane Lets Him Through" *(Level 2 intro)*
**Duration:** 15 seconds

> The forest entrance. A massive Aane stands directly across the path, still as stone.
>
> Gunda tries to go around — Aane shifts to block him. Other side — same.
>
> He stands there stuck. Then a sound from his bag. A soft crackling, like something stirring inside the egg.
>
> The Aane goes completely still. Lowers its head slowly toward the bag. One long breath through its trunk.
>
> It steps aside. Deliberate. Respectful.
>
> Gunda walks through, not fully understanding what just happened. The Aane watches him go.

**Note:** The forest recognised the egg before Gunda did. The Aane didn't let Gunda through — it let the egg through.

---

### SCENE 3 — "The Map Thief" *(Level 3 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Gunda stops to check his hand-drawn map (drawn by Appa before he left).
>
> A monkey drops from a branch, snatches the map, scurries up a tree. Gunda stares up in disbelief.
>
> Tries climbing — fails. Tries pleading in English — monkey laughs. Tries throwing a stick — misses completely.
>
> He looks at the egg in his bag. Tries Kannada words.
>
> The monkey pauses. Tilts its head. Impressed.
>
> Drops the map. Gunda catches it.

---

### SCENE 4 — "Night in the Forest" *(Level 4 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Dusk. Gunda has made camp — a lean-to shelter, small fire. Gubbi's egg glows warmly in his hands.
>
> A soft sound in the dark. Whimpering.
>
> He holds up his lamp. A small baby deer stands in the moonlight, lost, crying softly.
>
> Gunda approaches slowly. Speaks Kannada quietly. The deer calms. Looks at him with huge dark eyes.
>
> Then turns... and walks slowly down a narrow path Gunda hadn't noticed. The safe way forward.

---

### 🥚 MILESTONE 1 — "The Hatching" *(After Level 5)*
**Duration:** 45–60 seconds | **Song:** Baa Baare Gubbi (full)

> A sunlit clearing. Gunda is walking when the egg suddenly shakes violently in his bag. He pulls it out, holds it in both hands, panicking slightly.
>
> Cracks appear. Golden light spills through the shell.
>
> He kneels in the grass, egg cradled in his palms.
>
> A tiny beak pushes through. Then a wing. Then — Gubbi tumbles into his hands. Dull brown, eyes still closed.
>
> One eye opens. Then the other. Gubbi looks up at Gunda for the first time.
>
> Gunda is completely frozen. Then Gubbi makes a tiny sound — something between a chirp and a hum.
>
> Gunda's face breaks into the biggest smile of the film.
>
> **Baa Baare Gubbi plays.**
>
> On the far side of the clearing, Arjun stands with Kaage on his shoulder. Watching. He gives a small, genuine nod. Then turns and keeps climbing.

---

### SCENE 6 — "Bekku Appears" *(Level 6 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Gubbi walks beside Gunda now, tiny and unsteady. They're deeper — older trees, darker canopy.
>
> Gubbi freezes.
>
> Above them on a branch: a large forest cat sits perfectly still. Eyes unblinking. Watching.
>
> Gubbi presses against Gunda's leg. Gunda speaks respectful Kannada. Bekku's tail flicks once.
>
> It looks at Gubbi for a long moment. Then leaps silently into the dark canopy.
>
> Gunda exhales. They keep walking.
>
> In the canopy above: two amber eyes still follow.

---

### SCENE 7 — "Shelter from the Rain" *(Level 7 intro)*
**Duration:** 15 seconds

> The sky turns grey. One raindrop. Then a downpour.
>
> Gunda grabs Gubbi and runs. They find shelter under a giant taro leaf — big as a tent.
>
> They sit watching the rain fall. Gubbi shakes tiny feathers dry. Gunda reads the storm using Kannada weather words — and knows how long to wait.
>
> Gubbi grows two tiny wing feathers. Through the trees: Arjun's campfire. One ridge over. Not far at all.

---

### SCENE 8 — "The Lake Mirror" *(Level 8 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Dawn. A still forest lake.
>
> Gubbi walks to the water's edge and sees her reflection. Tilts head left — reflection tilts left. Chirps at it. The reflection chirps back (silently).
>
> Gubbi looks at Gunda in complete confusion.
>
> Gunda laughs — his first real laugh of the journey.
>
> He crouches beside her, points at the reflection, says her name in Kannada.
>
> Gubbi looks at the reflection. Looks at Gunda. Something clicks. She puffs up proudly.

---

### SCENE 9 — "Aame's Riddle" *(Level 9 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> The path is blocked by an old tortoise (Aame) sitting dead center. They wait. Aame doesn't move.
>
> Gunda walks around it — Aame slowly swivels to face him again.
>
> Aame opens its mouth. Speaks slowly — a Kannada riddle using question words.
>
> Gunda listens hard. Uses question words to answer.
>
> Aame considers for a long, long moment. Then shuffles sideways, very deliberately.
>
> As Gunda passes, Aame says one more thing. Gunda looks back: *"What did that mean?"*
>
> Gubbi shrugs. (A bird shrug.)

---

### 🐦 MILESTONE 2 — "Blue Wings" *(After Level 10)*
**Duration:** 45–60 seconds | **Song:** Ko Ko Koli Belagayteli

> They emerge from dense forest into a sun-drenched farm clearing halfway up the mountain.
>
> A rooster crows. Cows, goats, chickens everywhere. Gubbi has never seen this many animals. She goes completely still — then explodes, running toward them.
>
> Gunda watches her go. And then he sees it: in the morning light, Gubbi's wings catch the sun.
>
> **BLUE.** Not the dull brown of hatching — electric, iridescent, unmistakable Neelakantha blue.
>
> The farm animals recognize it. The rooster stops crowing and bows its head.
>
> **Ko Ko Koli plays.**
>
> Arjun arrives at the farm entrance from a different path. He looks at Gubbi's wings. His expression shifts — real respect.
>
> *"Okay,"* he says quietly. *"Race is on."*

---

### SCENE 11 — "The Fall" *(Level 11 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Narrow mountain paths. Stone ledges. Gubbi runs ahead on a log, showing off her blue wings.
>
> She misjudges. Falls.
>
> Gunda lunges. Misses. Time slows —
>
> Bekku is there. Paw extended. Catches Gubbi mid-fall. Sets her down gently.
>
> Gunda looks up at Bekku. Bekku looks back — not threatening, just present — then fades into the trees.
>
> They've been followed this whole time.
>
> Gubbi stands up, steadies herself, takes five determined steps forward.

---

### SCENE 12 — "The Monkey King's Test" *(Level 12 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> A rope bridge across a ravine — the only way forward. Blocked by a Monkey King on a throne of branches, flanked by his troop.
>
> He barks commands in Kannada: **"ಹೋಗು! ಬಾ! ನೋಡು! ಕೊಡು!"** (Go! Come! Look! Give!)
>
> Gunda responds with each verb. Gubbi performs each action perfectly — goes, comes back, looks around, gives Gunda a leaf.
>
> The troop goes quiet.
>
> Monkey King stands. Bows slightly. Gestures to the bridge.
>
> A monkey hands Gunda a note: a shortcut map.
>
> Gunda crosses. Looks back: Arjun is just arriving at the ravine, looking up at the throne.

---

### SCENE 13 — "The Last Camp" *(Level 13 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> The highest camp before the summit. Night. Stars are enormous up here — no city light.
>
> Gubbi mimics Gunda's stretching routine in slow motion. He watches her, laughing softly.
>
> He raises her up to see through the treeline — the summit of Karadi Betta. Almost there.
>
> A sound drifts down on the wind. Deep. Resonant. Something large.
>
> Gunda and Gubbi both go still. Gubbi's feathers stand on end — not in fear.
>
> In recognition.

---

### SCENE 14 — "Almost" *(Level 14 intro)*
**Duration:** 15–20 seconds

> Near the summit. Gubbi glides 2–3 seconds between trees — fully blue, almost glowing.
>
> Gunda is running.
>
> He rounds a bend and almost collides with Arjun, coming from the shortcut path.
>
> Both stop. Breathing hard. Look at each other.
>
> Arjun looks at Gubbi's wings. *"You actually made it,"* he says. Not mocking — genuine.
>
> They stand at the summit entrance together. Both birds on their shoulders.
>
> *"Together?"* Gunda asks.
>
> Arjun considers. Shrugs. *"After you."*

---

### 🕊️ MILESTONE 3 — "Gubbi Sings" *(After Level 15)*
**Duration:** 60–90 seconds | **Song:** Mane Hoda

> The summit clearing. Open sky in all directions. Mist below the mountain. Silence.
>
> Gubbi steps forward onto a flat stone in the center of the clearing.
>
> She opens her wings. Full electric blue — the Neelakantha in complete color.
>
> She begins to sing. Not bird sounds — the ancient song. Each note is a word they learned together.
>
> The trees respond. The mist begins to move.
>
> Something stirs at the edge of the clearing. Large. Slow.
>
> The **Karadi bear** steps into the light. Ancient. Calm. It looks at Gubbi. Then at Gunda. Its eyes carry something — recognition. Gunda thinks of Appa's voice at the door: *"The forest will know you tried."*
>
> **Mane Hoda plays.**
>
> The bear turns. Looks back once. Walks into the mountain forest.
>
> Gubbi lands on Gunda's shoulder.
>
> Arjun stands beside Gunda, silent. Kaage bows its head.
>
> Final shot: from the summit, looking out over the mist. Far below, somewhere in the haze — the glow of Bengaluru.
>
> Home.
