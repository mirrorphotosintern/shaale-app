## PART 1 — CHARACTER SHEETS

---

### GUNDA (Main Character)

**Visual Summary**
Chubby 8-year-old Indian boy. Pixar 3D. Warm brown skin, big wide expressive eyes, slightly messy black hair. Wears an orange embroidered cotton kurta (traditional Indian top, elbow-length sleeves, small mirror-work embroidery along the neckline and hem), dark brown shorts, brown leather chappals (open sandals). Carries a rounded canvas backpack, faded olive green, with a small handdrawn map tucked in the front pocket. His eyes do all the emotional heavy lifting — joy, terror, awe, confusion.

**Colour palette**
- Kurta: warm saffron / burnt orange `#E07A3B`
- Skin: warm medium brown `#8B5E3C`
- Hair: deep black-brown `#1A0F0A`
- Backpack: olive canvas `#8A7A5A`
- Shorts: dark brown `#4A2E1A`

**Expressions to establish in early scenes**
- Full wonder (eyes 200%, mouth slightly open)
- Confused-determined (furrowed brow, tight lips)
- Genuine laugh (crinkled eyes, head thrown back)
- Nervous-but-brave (deep breath, chin up)

**Character consistency notes**
- Always the same kurta — it gets slightly dirtier scene by scene
- The backpack sits high on his back; the egg causes a faint warm glow at the base of the pack
- He is NEVER scared in a way that makes him look small. Brave-nervous, not cowering-scared.

### GUBBI (Indian Roller / Neelakantha — Karnataka State Bird)

**What she is:** Indian Roller (*Coracias benghalensis*), the state bird of Karnataka. Famous for spectacular aerial rolls and iridescent electric blue wings. In real life: chestnut-brown body, brilliant blue wings, aqua-blue tail, turquoise throat patch.

**Gubbi's 4 Evolution Stages**

| Stage 2: Fledgling | L5–9 | Small iridescent patches on wings (not full blue yet), alert eyes, can flutter but not fly | Short hops, curious head tilts |
| Stage 3: Blue Wings | L10–14 | Full electric blue wings — unmistakable Neelakantha blue, turquoise breast patch | Glides 2–3 sec, runs ahead on paths |
| Stage 4: Full Flight | L15+ | Complete brilliant plumage — turquoise, royal blue, chestnut, electric blue flash | Soars freely, does aerial rolls |

**Colour palette (Stage 3 / Stage 4)**

- Belly: off-white cream `#F5EDD8`

**Personality expression** (Gubbi never speaks words — only movement and sound)
- Curiosity: rapid head-tilt left-right, eyes wide
- Excitement: short fast wing flaps, hop-hop-hop
- Fear/alert: feathers flat against body, completely still
- Pride: puffed up chest, chin up, single long wing stretch
- Comfort: tucks head toward Gunda, small sounds

---

### AMMA (Gunda's Mother)

**Visual Summary**
35-40 years old. Bengaluru urban woman. Warm, competent, slightly tired in the way all good mothers are. Wears a cotton salwar kameez in muted teal/green. Gold nose pin (small). Hair pulled back in a loose bun with a few strands escaped. Medium brown skin, soft eyes that show worry without showing it to Gunda.

**Key prop:** She is always doing something — folding clothes, handling packages, adjusting things. Never idle.

**Colour palette**
- Kameez: muted teal `#3D7A7A`
- Dupatta: soft white with small border `#F0EDE8`
- Skin: warm medium brown `#7A5035`

---

### APPA (Gunda's Father)

**Visual Summary**
38-42 years old. Bengaluru IT-professional type. Slightly soft, good-natured. Button-down shirt (grey-blue check), dark trousers, reading glasses on his nose. Carries the slightly awkward energy of a man who knows he should remember his mother tongue and doesn't. Tries anyway. Fails endearingly.

**Colour palette**
- Shirt: grey-blue check `#6B7A8A`
- Trousers: charcoal `#3A3A3A`

---

### AJJI (Gunda's Grandmother)

**Visual Summary**
68-70 years old. Round face, white hair pulled into a tight bun, gold earrings (large traditional loops). Wears a cotton saree — dark green with a deep red/gold border, simple and well-worn. Bare feet or worn rubber chappals. Skin: deep warm brown, many smile-lines, hands that show years of work. Her eyes are the warmest thing in any frame she's in.

**She is NEVER frail.** She is compact, powerful, rooted. Stands straight. Cooks while telling stories. Laughs loudly.

**Her setting:** A stone courtyard house at the edge of a village, surrounded by arecanut trees, with a tulsi plant at the entrance. Smoke from a wood fire inside.

**Colour palette**
- Saree: deep forest green `#1A4A2A` with red-gold border `#B8860B`
- Skin: deep warm brown `#5C3520`
- Hair: white `#F5F0E8`

---

### ARJUN (Rival / Eventual Ally)

**Visual Summary**
8-9 years old, same height as Gunda but leaner, quicker-moving. Confident body language — he walks like someone who knows where he's going. Dark navy half-sleeve shirt, dark grey shorts, proper trekking shoes (this kid came prepared). His bird Kaage (a crow) rides on his left shoulder constantly. Arjun's expression for most of the film: mildly amused, slightly ahead.

**Kaage (his crow):** Standard house crow — grey body, black hood, sharp intelligent eyes. Sits upright and alert on Arjun's shoulder. Crows are sacred in South Indian tradition — they carry messages to ancestors.

**Colour palette (Arjun)**
- Shirt: deep navy `#1E3A5F`
- Shorts: dark grey `#3A3A3A`

**Colour palette (Kaage)**
- Body: slate grey `#6B7280`
- Head/wings: glossy black `#111827`

---

### BEKKU (Forest Cat)

**Visual Summary**
A large Indian forest cat (loosely based on Jungle Cat *Felis chaus* / Leopard Cat hybrid). Tawny golden-brown coat with faint darker rosettes. Amber-gold eyes that catch light. Heavy paws, low centre of gravity, moves like water. NEVER threatening in posture — always watching. The stillness is what is unsettling, not aggression.

**Key visual:** When Bekku is in a scene, she is usually slightly out of focus in the background — visible but not featured. The moment she chooses to act is always a surprise.

**Colour palette**
- Base coat: warm tawny gold `#C4873A`
- Rosettes/pattern: darker burnt brown `#7A4A1A`
- Eyes: amber gold `#F59E0B`
- Nose: pale rose-brown

---

### AANE (The Elephant)

**Visual Summary**
An adult Indian elephant. Enormous, ancient-feeling. Deeply wrinkled grey-brown skin. Small tusks. Eyes that are slow and gentle — there is a thousand years of patience in them. When still, looks like a rock formation. When it turns to look at Gunda, it is overwhelming in scale.

**Key shot:** Always frame Gunda small against the Aane's size. The contrast is the whole point.

---

### AAME (Old Tortoise)

**Visual Summary**
A large Indian Star Tortoise (*Geochelone elegans*). Domed shell with beautiful geometric star patterns in yellow-black. Moves with geological slowness. Ancient dry face with sharp knowing eyes. Sits directly in the middle of the path and absolutely does not care about anyone's schedule.

---

### MONKEY KING

**Visual Summary**
A large male Bonnet Macaque (*Macaca radiata*) — South Indian monkey, pink-red face, fuzzy grey body, bonnet of hair swept back from the crown. The Monkey King sits on a throne of woven branches with a piece of vine as a scepter. His troop surrounds him. He speaks with the authority of someone who has given this same test many, many times.

---

### BABY DEER (Cheruve)

**Visual Summary**
A spotted deer fawn (*Axis axis*) — Spotted deer, very common in South Indian forests. Enormous dark eyes, white spots on reddish-brown fur. Lost and crying softly in the dark. When Gunda speaks Kannada, the deer goes still and looks at him with the kind of total trust that only very young creatures have.

---

### KARADI BEAR (The Spirit of Karadi Betta)

**Visual Summary**
A large Indian Sloth Bear (*Melursus ursinus*). But older-feeling. More deliberate. The Karadi bear moves like it has all the time in the world and doesn't need to hurry for anyone. Shaggy black fur, white V-chest marking, long curved claws. Eyes: unusually clear and calm — more like a Buddha's eyes than an animal's. When it looks at Gunda, it's looking at something beyond him — the lineage, the language, the continuity of the hill.

---

## PART 2 — VISUAL STYLE GUIDE

**Base art direction:** Pixar-quality 3D animation. Warm, handcrafted-feeling. Slightly soft textures — the forest doesn't look like a video game forest, it looks like a Malgudi childhood. Reference: *Moana* for lush natural settings + *Inside Out* for expressive characters.

**Lighting philosophy:**
- Phase 1 (L1–5): Golden morning light, warm and golden, safe feeling
- Phase 2 (L6–10): Filtered forest canopy light, more dramatic, then opens at the farm
- Phase 3 (L11–15): Mountain cool light, thin air clarity, blue shadows, gold summits

**Camera language:**
- Wide shots: establish scale (Gunda small against forest/mountain)
- Close-ups: Gubbi's face, Gunda's face, the egg glow — emotional beats
- Over-the-shoulder: Gunda's POV into the forest, mystery ahead
- Low angle: animals (Aane, Bekku) to emphasise their power

**Consistent elements across all scenes:**
- The egg/Gubbi always shows glow when Kannada is learned correctly
- Karadi Betta is always visible in background as a distant peak (before they reach it)
- Ajji's village lights are visible from L10 onwards — just visible in haze far below/ahead
- Gunda's kurta accumulates small patches of dirt scene by scene

> Duration target per prompt is noted.

---

### SCENE 0 — "Ajji's Package"
**Target:** 20–25 seconds | Before Level 1

```
Pixar 3D animation. Warm Indian apartment interior at dusk — wood furniture,
brass vessels on shelves, a small tulsi plant near the window. Low warm light.

An Indian boy (Gunda: 8yrs, chubby, orange embroidered kurta, dark shorts,
wide expressive dark eyes, messy black hair) kneels beside a large brown
paper package and tears it open. He pushes past sweets and wrapped items
with focused urgency, digging to the bottom. He finds a small cloth bundle —
unwraps it to reveal a smooth cream-coloured egg with a faint amber glow.
He holds it up in both hands, awed. A handwritten letter falls out — dense
Kannada script, front and back. Camera close-up on the letter: completely
unreadable Kannada characters fill the frame.

Cut to: a woman (Amma: 35yrs, teal salwar kameez, bun hairstyle, gold nose
pin) takes the letter, frowns, tries to read it, shakes her head. A man
(Appa: 40yrs, grey-blue check shirt, reading glasses) does the same. Both
helpless.

Amma takes the egg, wraps it carefully in cloth, places it gently inside
Gunda's olive canvas backpack. She puts the letter in beside it.

Gunda zips the bag. He looks at the front door. Nobody stops him.

Mood: warm golden indoor light transitioning to the quiet before an adventure.
Cinematic. Emotionally grounded. Pixar lighting quality.
```

---

### SCENE 1 — "Goodbye"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 1 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Exterior of a 1990s Bengaluru apartment building,
warm morning light, golden hour.

Indian boy Gunda (8yrs, chubby, orange embroidered kurta, olive canvas
backpack, messy hair, wide eyes) stands at the building entrance. His
mother Amma (35yrs, teal salwar kameez) holds his face in both hands for
a long warm moment, then lets go. His father Appa (40yrs, grey-blue shirt)
gives him a firm shoulder-pat.

Quick sequence: the building watchman (50yrs, khaki uniform) waves from
his booth. A neighbour aunty leans over her second-floor balcony railing
and calls something. A younger boy runs up from the ground floor and gives
Gunda a fistbump.

Gunda turns. Walks. Camera stays at street level as he gets smaller —
city to road to treeline in the distance. The outline of a forested hill
(Karadi Betta) against the morning sky.

Mood: bittersweet and hopeful. Soft golden morning light. Wide final shot.
```

---

### SCENE 2 — "The Aane Lets Him Through"
**Target:** 15 seconds | Level 2 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Lush South Indian forest entrance — dense canopy,
dappled afternoon light, thick roots, red earth path.

An enormous Indian elephant (Aane) stands perfectly still across the
narrow forest path, blocking it completely. Ancient wrinkled grey skin,
small tusks, slow patient eyes.

Wide shot: Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta, olive backpack) approaches and tries
to step around the left — the Aane shifts its weight to block. Tries the
right — same. Gunda stops, helpless.

Then: from Gunda's backpack comes a soft sound — a faint crackling, like
something stirring. A faint amber glow at the base of the backpack.

Camera slow push-in on the Aane's face: it goes completely still.
Lowers its enormous head slowly toward the backpack. Takes one slow long
breath through its trunk, eyes half-closed.

It steps aside. Deliberate. Unhurried. Respectful. Not moving for Gunda —
moving for what is in the bag.

Gunda walks through. The Aane watches him go, head still lowered.

Mood: mysterious reverence. Afternoon forest light. The scale contrast
between enormous elephant and small boy is the visual point.
```

---

### SCENE 3 — "The Map Thief"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 3 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. South Indian forest trail, mid-morning, warm dappled light.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta, olive backpack, messy hair) has stopped on the
trail and is examining a hand-drawn paper map (rough, ink, Appa's handwriting).
He holds it up comparing it to the path.

A Bonnet Macaque monkey drops from the branch directly above him, snatches
the map from his hands, and scurries straight up the tree trunk. The monkey
sits on a high branch, examining the map with great interest and absolutely
no apology.

Gunda tries: jumping to climb the tree (fails, slides down). Talking in
English (monkey ignores him, looks bored). Throwing a small stick (misses
completely, hits a different tree).

Gunda looks down at his backpack. Looks up at the monkey. Tries speaking
in Kannada.

The monkey pauses mid-inspection of the map. Tilts its head.
Looks at Gunda with new interest. Then drops the map.

Gunda catches it, surprised. Looks up. The monkey gives a single chin-nod
(the universal respect gesture) and disappears into the canopy.

Mood: warm comedy then genuine surprise. Dappled forest light. Slapstick
energy transitioning to earned respect.
```

---

### SCENE 4 — "Night in the Forest"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 4 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Forest campsite at dusk — a small lean-to shelter made
of branches, a tiny campfire with orange light. Dense dark forest beyond.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta slightly dusty now, olive backpack beside him)
sits by the fire holding the glowing egg carefully in both hands. Warm
amber light from the egg and fire combined.

A soft whimper in the dark. Gunda holds up a small lamp.

In the moonlight at the edge of the trees: a baby spotted deer fawn
(Cheruve) — enormous dark eyes, white spots, standing alone and lost,
crying very quietly.

Gunda sets the egg carefully down. Approaches slowly on his knees —
no sudden movements. He speaks very quietly in Kannada.

The fawn goes still. Its crying stops. It looks at him with total trust.

Then turns. Walks slowly down a narrow path Gunda hadn't noticed —
through the trees to the right. The safe way.

Gunda looks where it walked. Then back at his fire.
Picks up the egg. Follows.

Mood: tender and quiet. Moonlit forest. The sound of night forest insects.
Warm fire glow against deep dark woods.
```

---

### MILESTONE 1 — "The Hatching"
**Target:** 45–60 seconds | After Level 5 — use BAA BAARE GUBBI song

```
Pixar 3D animation. Cinematic quality. A sunlit forest clearing — golden
midday light through a high canopy gap, soft grass, wildflowers.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta, olive backpack) is walking when his backpack
begins to shake violently. He stops. Pulls off the pack, reaches in,
brings out the egg — it's shaking in both his hands, something pushing
from inside. He kneels in the grass, holds it cradled in his palms.

Slow cinematic sequence: a hairline crack appears. Another.
Golden light spills through. More cracks. A tiny beak pushes through the
shell — one determined peck, two. A small wing. Then the shell splits.

Gubbi tumbles into his palms — tiny, dull brown, eyes still closed, damp
feathers, completely helpless. She fits entirely in his cupped hands.

Gunda holds completely still. Not breathing.

One eye opens. Slowly. Then the other. Gubbi looks up at Gunda.

A small sound — something between a chirp and a hum.

Gunda's face: the biggest, most unguarded smile of the entire film.
His eyes fill.

MUSIC: Baa Baare Gubbi begins.

Wide shot from above: Gunda in the clearing, Gubbi in his hands,
sun lighting them both. Forest all around.

Cut to: at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden in shadow — Arjun
(8yrs, lean, dark navy shirt) stands watching with Kaage (black crow)
on his shoulder. He gives a single small genuine nod. Then turns
and keeps walking up the mountain.

Hold on Gubbi's face — those tiny first eyes, looking up at Gunda.

Mood: cinematic. Earned emotion. Warm golden light. This is the
emotional peak of Phase 1.
```

---

### SCENE 6 — "Bekku Appears"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 6 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Deep South Indian forest. Older trees — massive roots,
dark canopy, filtered green-gold light. Afternoon, slightly ominous.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta, olive backpack) walks slowly. Gubbi (Stage 1:
dull brown hatchling, clumsy walk) walks beside his feet, exploring.

Gubbi suddenly FREEZES. Body rigid. Feathers flat.

Camera follows her eyeline up — to a large branch above the path.
A big forest cat (Bekku: tawny golden fur, faint rosettes, amber eyes)
sits perfectly still on the branch. Not threatening — just watching.
Absolute stillness.

Gubbi presses back against Gunda's ankle.

Gunda speaks — careful, respectful Kannada words.

Bekku's tail moves once, slow, a single sweep. Those amber eyes shift
from Gubbi to Gunda. A long, considering look.

Then Bekku stands, turns, and leaps silently into the dark canopy.
Gone between blinks.

Gunda exhales slowly. Gubbi doesn't move for another second.

Final shot: looking up into the dark canopy. Two amber points of light —
still watching — then gone.

Mood: suspenseful then released. The forest has depth beyond what Gunda
can see. Bekku was never threatening but was never safe either.
```

---

### SCENE 7 — "Shelter from the Rain"
**Target:** 15 seconds | Level 7 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. South Indian forest, mountain trail. Sky turns grey fast.

One raindrop hits Gunda's nose. He looks up. Then: downpour.

Gunda grabs Gubbi (Stage 1: dull brown, tiny) and runs. Camera
tracking run through the forest. He spots a massive taro leaf
(colocasia) — genuinely huge, tent-sized. Ducks under it.

They sit, dry. Rain hammers the leaf above them. The sound is enormous.

Gubbi shakes tiny brown feathers dry, irritated. She looks at Gunda:
whose idea was this hike exactly?

Gunda looks out at the rain, reads the sky, says some Kannada weather
words quietly to himself — figuring it out. Nods: not long now.

He looks to the right through the trees: one ridge over, barely visible
through rain — the orange glow of a campfire. Arjun's camp. Closer
than expected.

Gunda's jaw sets. He picks up Gubbi. Pulls her close under his kurta.

Mood: cosy-uncomfortable. Grey forest light under the leaf. The rain
sound is important. Shot is mostly wide — the giant leaf making them
look even smaller.
```

---

### SCENE 8 — "The Lake Mirror"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 8 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Dawn. A still, glassy forest lake — perfectly
reflecting the pink-orange sky and treeline. Absolute silence except
for birds starting their morning.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta) sits on the bank, washing his face.

Gubbi (Stage 2: fledgling, small iridescent wing patches, alert eyes)
has wandered to the water's edge nearby. She looks down at her
reflection in the still water.

Tilts head left. Reflection tilts left.
Tilts head right. Reflection right.
Chirps. Reflection (silently) chirps back.

Gubbi looks up at Gunda in complete confusion. Then back down.
Then up again.

Gunda watches and laughs — genuine, surprised laughter, the best
kind. He wipes his eyes.

He comes over. Crouches beside her. Points at the reflection,
then at Gubbi. Says her name in Kannada.

Gubbi looks at the reflection. Looks at Gunda. Something clicks.

She puffs her chest feathers out. Lifts her chin. Stares at
the reflection with great satisfaction.

Final shot: both of them reflected in the still lake.
The pink dawn sky above them.

Mood: joy and wonder. Quiet. The best morning. Dawn pastels.
```

---

### SCENE 9 — "Aame's Riddle"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 9 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Forest trail blocked by a rock — or wait, that's
not a rock. A massive Indian Star Tortoise (Aame) sits dead center
in the path, shell domed and patterned with geometric stars, moving
with absolute geological indifference.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta, olive backpack) and Gubbi (Stage 2:
small iridescent patches) approach. They wait. Aame doesn't move.

Gunda tries to walk around — Aame VERY slowly turns to face him again.
The slowness is somehow more blocking than speed.

Then Aame opens its ancient mouth. Speaks — slow measured Kannada
riddle, using question words: ಏನು? ಎಲ್ಲಿ? ಯಾರು? (What? Where? Who?)

Gunda listens hard. Gubbi tilts her head. Gunda uses the question
words, answering back. His Kannada is halting but genuine.

Aame considers. Long. Slow blinks. The whole forest seems to pause.

Then shuffles sideways — very deliberately — perhaps six inches.
But it's enough.

As Gunda squeezes past, Aame says one more slow thing.
Gunda stops, turns: "What did that mean?"

Gubbi shrugs. It is a perfect bird shrug.

Mood: dry comedy. Patient ancient versus impatient child energy.
Dappled midday forest light. The tortoise wins every interaction
simply by being very, very slow.
```

---

### MILESTONE 2 — "Blue Wings"
**Target:** 45–60 seconds | After Level 10 — use KO KO KOLI song

```
Pixar 3D animation. Cinematic quality. Dense dark forest trail
suddenly opens onto a wide sun-drenched farm clearing halfway up
the mountain — a wall of warm golden light after deep shade.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta dustier now, olive backpack) and Gubbi
(Stage 2: fledgling) emerge blinking into the brightness.
Sound: a rooster crows. Then another.

The clearing explodes with life — chickens, a pair of goats, a cow
with a bell, a man plowing in the distance. Gubbi has never seen
this many animals. She goes completely still for one moment —
then SPRINTS toward them, wings flapping.

Gunda watches her run. And then he sees it:

In the full morning sunlight, as Gubbi runs with wings half-extended —
colour. Electric blue. Not the dull brown he's known for two months.
The Neelakantha blue, finally visible in full Karnataka sun.

Camera slow-motion close-up: Gubbi's wings mid-flap,
electric azure and cobalt catching the light, iridescent.

The rooster stops crowing. Turns. Bows its head.
The cow's bell goes quiet. All the animals look at Gubbi.

Gunda stands in the middle of it, backpack sliding off one shoulder,
mouth open.

MUSIC: Ko Ko Koli begins.

Then: from the far end of the clearing — Arjun (lean, dark navy shirt,
Kaage crow on shoulder) arrives from a different path. He stops
when he sees Gubbi. His expression shifts — not jealousy. Genuine,
quiet respect.

He walks toward Gunda. "Okay," he says quietly. "Race is on."

Wide shot: both boys in the golden clearing, their birds,
the farm, and above everything — the peak of Karadi Betta
still high above.

Mood: cinematic joy. Golden farm light. This is earned colour.
```

---

### SCENE 11 — "The Fall"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 11 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. High narrow mountain path — stone ledges,
steep drop to the right, tall trees to the left. Mountain atmosphere.

Gubbi (Stage 3: full blue wings, visibly confident now) runs ahead
on a horizontal log that bridges a gap in the path. She spreads
her blue wings and flaps them, showing off.

She misjudges the end of the log. Her foot catches. She goes over the
edge — dropping.

Gunda: "GUBBI!" He lunges. Misses. His hand closes on air.

Time slows.

From the left: a large paw — silent, from nowhere. Bekku
(tawny forest cat) has extended one paw from the rocky ledge.
Catches Gubbi mid-fall. Sets her down on the path.

Bekku looks at Gunda. Then at Gubbi. Then — with a slow
unhurried movement — steps back into the trees.

Gone.

They've been followed this whole time.

Gunda and Gubbi stare at the empty trees.

Gubbi stands up. Steadies herself. Takes five very determined
steps forward.

Mood: sudden fear, then relief, then revelation.
Mountain light, blue sky, the abyss of the drop.
Bekku is never fully lit — always edge-lit, partly shadow.
```

---

### SCENE 12 — "The Monkey King's Test"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 12 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. A rope bridge across a mountain ravine —
the only forward path visible. On the far side, blocking the bridge:
a throne of woven branches where a large male Bonnet Macaque
(Monkey King: big, pink-red face, hair swept back) sits with
elaborate dignity. His troop fills the trees around him.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta) and Gubbi (Stage 3: full blue wings)
approach. The Monkey King speaks — deliberate, loud Kannada commands:
ಹೋಗು! (Go!) He points at Gunda.

Gunda takes three steps back.

ಬಾ! (Come!) The King points forward.

Gunda walks forward.

ನೋಡು! (Look!) The King points upward.

Gunda looks up.

Then the King points at Gubbi: ಕೊಡು! (Give!)

Gubbi walks to Gunda's feet. Picks up a small leaf from the ground.
Walks back to Gunda and places it in his hand.

The monkey troop goes absolutely silent.

The Monkey King stands. Gives a small, unhurried bow toward Gubbi.

One monkey from the troop comes down and hands Gunda a rolled
piece of bark — a map. A shortcut.

The King gestures to the bridge. Gunda crosses.

As he reaches the middle of the bridge, he looks back:
at the far end of the ravine, Arjun is just arriving,
looking up at the throne. Gunda keeps walking.

Mood: ceremonial absurdity with genuine stakes.
Mountain light, ravine depth. The Monkey King is genuinely
impressive despite his throne of branches.
```

---

### SCENE 13 — "The Last Camp"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 13 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. The highest camp before the summit.
Night. Stars are extraordinary up here — no city light pollution,
milky way visible, enormous. The air has changed — thinner, colder.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta, small campfire) stretches — both arms
up, big yawn, twist left, twist right.

Gubbi (Stage 3: full blue wings, folded at rest) watches him
for a moment. Then begins to copy the stretch in slow motion —
both wings out, long hold. Then the twist — her tail feathers
going left, going right. Watching Gunda. Copying exactly.

Gunda notices. Doesn't stop stretching. They stretch together
in the firelight.

He lifts her in both hands — raises her up above the treeline
where the summit of Karadi Betta is visible against the stars.
Very close. Tomorrow.

A sound drifts down on the wind. Deep. Resonant.
Something large, somewhere above.

Gunda and Gubbi both go completely still.

Gubbi's feathers rise — not pressed flat in fear.
Rising. Alert. Something else.

Recognition.

Final shot: looking up at the dark summit against the stars.

Mood: quiet wonder transitioning to anticipation.
Firelight warm against cold dark mountain. The stars
are important — use them.
```

---

### SCENE 14 — "Almost"
**Target:** 15–20 seconds | Level 14 intro

```
Pixar 3D animation. Near the summit — rocky paths, sparse trees,
thin mountain air. The sky has that high-altitude clarity.

Gubbi (Stage 3: full blue wings) glides 2–3 seconds between trees,
fully airborne for brief moments — almost flying.
In the mountain light, she is brilliant.

Gunda (8yrs, orange kurta now dusty and slightly torn at the hem,
olive backpack) runs. He is tired but moving fast, close to something.

He rounds a stone bend and almost collides with Arjun
(8yrs, dark navy shirt, Kaage the crow on shoulder) coming
from the shortcut path on the right.

Both stop. Hands on knees. Breathing hard.

They look at each other. Both dirty, both tired, both almost there.

Arjun looks at Gubbi, gliding between the last trees before the
summit clearing. He watches her for a moment.

"You actually made it," he says. Not mocking. Genuine.

They stand at the summit entrance — two stone pillars framing
the path up. Both birds on their shoulders.

Gunda looks at the summit. "Together?"

Arjun looks at the summit. A beat. Shrugs.

"After you."

Final wide shot: both boys standing at the entrance,
the summit above, the world below in haze.

Mood: the moment before the end. Mountain cold, clear sky,
the warmth of unexpected friendship.
Both characters are exhausted and completely alive.

### MILESTONE 3 — "Gubbi Sings"
**Target:** 60–90 seconds | After Level 15 — use MANE HODA song

```
Pixar 3D animation. Cinematic peak quality. The summit of Karadi Betta —
a wide open clearing, flat stone at the center, 360-degree view.
Mist fills the valleys below. The sky above is perfect clear blue.

Silence.

Gubbi (Stage 4: FULL ELECTRIC PLUMAGE — brilliant azure wings,
turquoise throat, chestnut back, white belly — the complete Neelakantha)
steps forward from Gunda's shoulder onto a flat stone at the clearing's
center. Every feather fully extended.

She opens her wings. Full span. In this light, she is
almost unbearably beautiful.

She begins to sing. Not bird sounds — something ancient,
structured, melodic. Each note is a Kannada word.

The trees at the clearing's edge respond — leaves
turning slightly, as if listening.

The mist below begins to move.

Something at the edge of the clearing. Large. Very slow.

The KARADI BEAR steps into the light. Ancient. Massive.
Shaggy black fur, white chest V. It moves with total calm.

It looks at Gubbi. Then at Gunda. Its eyes —
unusually still, unusually clear — hold something
beyond recognition. Continuity. Memory.

Gunda thinks of Appa at the door, the day he left.

MUSIC: Mane Hoda begins.

The bear turns. Looks back once, directly at Gunda.
Then walks into the forest and is gone.

Gubbi lands on Gunda's shoulder.

Arjun stands beside Gunda. Kaage bows its head.

Neither boy speaks.

Final slow pull-out shot from the summit —
two boys, two birds, one ancient peak.
Far below in the golden haze at the horizon:
the orange glow of city lights. Home.

Smash cut to black.

Mood: culmination. Sacred. Every visual element
earned across 15 levels.
The cinematography should feel like a final chapter, not an ending.
